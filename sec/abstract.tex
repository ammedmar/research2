\begin{abstract}
	My ongoing research program, which has been very successful to date, concerns the combinatorial and computational aspects of algebraic topology with impact in applied mathematics and lattice field theory. As a member of Kathryn Hess' group, I wrote the mathematical content of a grant approved for over 1 million USD.
